# Warping Framework

A layered framework for AI-assisted development with consistent standards and workflows.

## When This Skill Activates

This skill automatically loads when you:
- Start work in a warping-enabled project (has `./warping/` directory)
- Reference warping, project standards, or coding conventions
- Run tests, make commits, or perform quality checks
- Ask about project structure, workflows, or best practices

## Core Principle: Rule Precedence

Warping uses hierarchical rules where more specific overrides general:

```
user.md          ← HIGHEST precedence (personal preferences)
  ↓
project.md       ← Project-specific rules
  ↓
{language}.md    ← Language standards (python.md, go.md, typescript.md, cpp.md)
  ↓
{tool}.md        ← Tool guidelines (taskfile.md, git.md)
  ↓
main.md          ← General AI behavior
  ↓
specification.md ← LOWEST precedence (requirements)
```

**IMPORTANT**: If `user.md` says one thing and `python.md` says another, `user.md` ALWAYS wins.

## File Reading Strategy (Lazy Loading)

**DO NOT** read all warping files at once. Read only what you need:

1. **Always start with**: `./warping/main.md` (general guidelines)
2. **Check for**: `./warping/core/user.md` (personal overrides - highest precedence)
3. **Check for**: `./warping/core/project.md` (project-specific rules)
4. **Then read language-specific** only if working with that language:
   - `./warping/languages/python.md`
   - `./warping/languages/go.md`
   - `./warping/languages/typescript.md`
   - `./warping/languages/cpp.md`
5. **Read tool files** only when using that tool:
   - `./warping/tools/taskfile.md` (when running tasks)
   - `./warping/scm/git.md` (when using git)
   - `./warping/scm/github.md` (when using GitHub)

## Task-Centric Workflow

Warping projects use **Taskfile** as the universal task runner.

### Discovery
```bash
task --list        # See all available tasks
task               # Same as task --list
```

### Common Tasks
```bash
task check         # Pre-commit checks (fmt, lint, test, coverage)
task test          # Run tests
task test:coverage # Run with coverage
task fmt           # Format code
task lint          # Lint code
task build         # Build project
task clean         # Clean artifacts
```

**CRITICAL**: Before commits, ALWAYS run `task check`. Never claim checks passed without running them.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Warping embraces TDD by default:

1. **Write test first** - Define expected behavior
2. **Watch it fail** - Confirm test fails correctly
3. **Implement** - Write minimal code to pass
4. **Refactor** - Improve while keeping tests green
5. **Repeat** - Build incrementally

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Default: ≥85% coverage (overall + per-module)
- Check `project.md` for project-specific thresholds
- Never claim coverage passes without running `task test:coverage`

## Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

For new features or projects:

1. **Build PRD.md** - Run `warping.sh spec` to create Product Requirements Document
2. **AI Interview** - Answer focused questions to clarify requirements
3. **PRD.md Review** - Let user review/change PRD.md if they want
4. **Generate SPECIFICATION.md** - use PRD.md + Warping rules to build a complete spec with phases, dependencies, and tasks
5. **SPECIFICATION.md review** -- Let user review/change SPECIFICATION.md if they want
5. **Implement** - Build according to spec, following all applicable warping rules

## Quality Standards

### Before Every Commit
```bash
task check  # MUST run this
```

This typically includes:
- Code formatting
- Linting
- Type checking
- Tests with coverage
- Any project-specific checks

### Conventional Commits
ALL commits must follow https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/:

```
feat: add new feature
fix: resolve bug
docs: update documentation
chore: routine tasks
test: add/update tests
refactor: code restructuring
```

### File Naming
- Use **hyphens** in filenames, not underscores
- Example: `user-service.py` NOT `user_service.py`
- Exception: Language conventions (Python modules can use underscores in code)

### Secrets Management
- Store secrets in `secrets/` directory
- Provide `.example` templates
- Never commit actual secrets
- Use environment variables in code

## Language-Specific Standards

### Python
- Testing: pytest, ≥85% coverage
- Style: ruff, black, isort (PEP 8)
- Types: mypy strict mode
- Docs: PEP 257 docstrings

### Go
- Testing: Testify, ≥85% coverage
- Docs: go.dev/doc/comment
- Patterns: table-driven tests, interface design

### TypeScript
- Testing: Vitest/Jest, ≥85% coverage
- Style: ESLint, Prettier
- Types: strict mode, no `any`

### C++
- Testing: Catch2/GoogleTest, ≥85% coverage
- Standard: C++20/23
- Style: clang-format, clang-tidy

## New Project Workflow

When user says "start a new project with warping", "use warping to build X", or similar, follow this complete workflow:

### Step 1: Initialize Warping Structure
```bash
./warping.sh init
```
- Creates `./warping/` directory with framework files
- Sets up `secrets/` directory
- Creates basic `Taskfile.yml`
- Adds `.gitignore` for secrets

### Step 2: User Configuration (First Time Only)
Check if `./warping/core/user.md` exists. If not:
```bash
./warping.sh bootstrap
```
- Prompts for user name
- Sets default coverage threshold
- Configures primary languages
- Creates personalized `user.md`

### Step 3: Project Configuration
```bash
./warping.sh project
```
- Prompts for project name
- Selects project type (CLI, TUI, REST API, Web App, Library, Other)
- Chooses primary language
- Sets coverage threshold
- Creates `project.md` with standards

### Step 4: Specification-Driven Development
```bash
./warping.sh spec
```

This launches the full SDD workflow:

**a) Generate PRD.md**:
- Prompts for project name, description, and initial features
- Creates `PRD.md` with structured template
- Displays full path to PRD.md

**b) Conduct AI Interview**:
- Read the PRD.md thoroughly
- Ask focused, non-trivial questions to clarify:
  - Missing decisions and edge cases
  - Implementation details and architecture
  - UX considerations and constraints  
  - Dependencies and tradeoffs
- Each question should have numbered options plus "other"
- Continue until ambiguity is minimized

**c) User Review of PRD**:
- Let user review/edit PRD.md if they want
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding

**d) Generate SPECIFICATION.md**:
- Use PRD.md + warping rules to create complete implementation spec
- Include clear phases, subphases, and tasks
- Map dependencies (what blocks what)
- Identify parallel work opportunities
- NO code in specification - just the plan

**e) User Review of Specification**:
- Let user review/edit SPECIFICATION.md if they want
- Wait for confirmation before implementation

**f) Begin Implementation**:
- Follow the SPECIFICATION.md plan
- Apply all warping rules (TDD, quality standards, task-centric)
- Maintain ≥85% coverage
- Run `task check` before each commit
- Use Conventional Commits format

### Step 5: Development Cycle
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Implement features incrementally
- Run `task check` frequently
- Commit with proper format
- Push changes

## Project Initialization (Quick Reference)

### For New Projects (Full Workflow)
Use the "New Project Workflow" above when starting from scratch.

### For Existing Warping Projects
1. Check for `./warping/` directory
2. Read `./warping/main.md` for general guidelines
3. Read `./warping/core/user.md` for user preferences
4. Read `./warping/core/project.md` for project rules
5. Run `task --list` to see available tasks

### For New Features in Existing Projects
1. Consider running `./warping.sh spec` for complex features
2. Follow SDD process (PRD → Interview → Specification → Implement)
3. Or for simple features, just follow TDD directly

## Self-Improvement Mechanism

Warping learns and evolves:

- `meta/lessons.md` - Patterns learned during development (AI can update)
- `meta/ideas.md` - Future improvements noticed
- `meta/suggestions.md` - Project-specific suggestions

When you discover a better pattern or make repeated corrections, consider updating `lessons.md`.

## Safety and Best Practices

### Version Control
- Never force-push without explicit permission
- Assume production impact unless stated otherwise
- Prefer small, reversible changes
- Call out risks explicitly

### Code Quality
- Run `task check` before EVERY commit
- Verify tests pass: `task test`
- Check coverage meets threshold: `task test:coverage`
- Never claim checks passed without running them

### Documentation
- Keep docs in `docs/` directory, not project root
- Update docs when changing behavior
- Use RFC2119 notation in technical docs (!, ~, ?, ⊗, ≉)

## Working with Warping

### First Time in a Project
1. Check for `./warping/` directory
2. Read `./warping/main.md`
3. Check `./warping/core/user.md` for user preferences
4. Check `./warping/core/project.md` for project rules
5. Run `task --list` to see available tasks

### During Development
1. Write tests first (TDD)
2. Implement features
3. Run `task check` frequently
4. Before commit: ALWAYS `task check`
5. Use Conventional Commits format
6. Push changes

### When Stuck
- Check `./warping/REFERENCES.md` for guidance on which files to read
- Review `meta/lessons.md` for learned patterns
- Consult language-specific files in `./warping/languages/`
- Check `Taskfile.yml` for available commands

## Example Workflows

### Starting a Feature
```bash
# 1. Write test first (TDD)
# 2. Watch it fail
task test

# 3. Implement feature
# 4. Run checks
task check

# 5. Commit
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

### Code Review
```bash
# 1. Run quality checks
task check

# 2. Review coverage
task test:coverage

# 3. Check commit format (Conventional Commits)
git log --oneline -n 5

# 4. Suggest improvements → meta/suggestions.md
```

### Bug Fix
```bash
# 1. Write failing test that reproduces bug
# 2. Fix code
# 3. Verify test passes
task test

# 4. Run full checks
task check

# 5. Commit
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with X"
```
